I created this code for Prof. Jeff Leek's Data Analysis Coursera course.

This code creates a regression model assessing which factors go into determining the interest rate on a peer-to-peer loan.

Here is the R code to download the dataset:

download.file("https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/dataanalysis/loansData.csv", destfile="./loansData.csv", method="curl")

dateDownloaded <- date()

The code generates several images that you may or may not find helpful. Please don't be alarmed.
